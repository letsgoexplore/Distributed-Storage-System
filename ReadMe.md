### Code Structure
- design: illustrating code structure
- network_layer: define the 'Node' data structure, handling its behaviours
- data_layer: define the 'Data' data structure, handling its behaviours
- operation: list all the behaviour the node will be acting, act as state transition trigger in the state machine
- main: currently no 'main.py', it's now in 'operation.py' for convinience.
